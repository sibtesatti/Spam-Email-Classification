# Spam-Email-Classification

Classification algorithms allow us to categorize data into pre-defined classes or labels. Whether it's predicting customer churn, detecting spam emails, or diagnosing diseases, these techniques are at the heart of predictive modeling.

Key classification steps: Data preparation: Clean your data set by handling missing values, coding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. A solid foundation ensures accurate predictions. Model Selection: Explore Different Classification Algorithms: Logistic Regression: A Driver for Binary Classification. Decision trees: Intuitive and interpretable. Support Vector Machines (SVM): Powerful for complex boundaries. Choose the right algorithm based on your problem and dataset characteristics. Model training: Split your data into training and test sets. Train your chosen classification model on the training data. Model Evaluation: Metrics Matter! Assess your model's performance using: Accuracy: Overall correctness. Accuracy: How many predicted positives are true positives. Let's recall: How many true positives were captured. F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall. Cross-validation ensures that your model will generalize well.
